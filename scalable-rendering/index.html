The major deployment platform for this work is the scalable rendering library <a href="http://icet.sandia.gov/" target="_blank">IceT</a>, which is made freely available. Our main approach is a technique known as sort-last parallel rendering, but along the way we introduce several simple to implement but powerful modifications that greatly improve the efficiency including minimal copy image interlacing for better load balancing and telescoping compositing for arbitrary job sizes. Visit the <a href="http://icet.sandia.gov/" target="_blank">IceT</a> project page for access to the software, documentation, and further papers and information on scalable rendering.

              <h3>Abstract</h3>
              <p> A key component of most large-scale rendering systems is a parallel image compositing algorithm, and the most commonly used compositing algorithms are binary swap and its variants. Although shown to be very efficient, one of the classic limitations of binary swap is that it only works on a number of processes that is a perfect power of 2. Multiple variations of binary swap have been independently introduced to overcome this limitation and handle process counts that have factors that are not 2. To date, few of these approaches have been directly compared against each other, making it unclear which approach is best. This paper presents a fresh implementation of each of these methods using a common software framework to make them directly comparable. These methods to run binary swap with odd factors are directly compared. The results show that some simple compositing approaches work as well or better than more complex algorithms that are more difficult to implement.</p>

              <h3>Abstract</h3>
              <p>The only proven method for performing distributed-memory parallel rendering at large scales, tens of thousands of nodes, is a class of algorithms called sort last. The fundamental operation of sort-last parallel rendering is an image composite, which combines a collection of images generated independently on each node into a single blended image. Over the years numerous image compositing algorithms have been proposed as well as several enhancements and rendering modes to these core algorithms. However, the testing of these image compositing algorithms has been with an arbitrary set of enhancements, if any are applied at all. In this paper we take a leading production-quality image compositing framework, <a href="http://icet.sandia.gov/" target="_blank">IceT</a>, and use it as a testing framework for the leading image compositing algorithms of today. As we scale IceT to ever increasing job sizes, we consider the image compositing systems holistically, incorporate numerous optimizations, and discover several improvements to the process never considered before. We conclude by demonstrating our solution on 64K cores of the Intrepid BlueGene/P at Argonne National Laboratories.</p>

In <em>Proceedings of IEEE 2001 Symposium on Parallel and Large-Data Visualization and Graphics</em>, October 2001, pp. 85&ndash;92.</p>
              <h3>Abstract</h3>
              <p>Due to the impressive price-performance of today&rsquo;s PC- based graphics accelerator cards, Sandia National Laboratories is attempting to use PC clusters to render extremely large data sets in interactive applications. This paper describes a sort-last parallel rendering system running on a PC cluster that is capable of rendering enormous amounts of geometry onto high-resolution tile displays by taking advantage of the spatial coherency that is inherent in our data. Furthermore, it is capable of scaling to larger sized input data or higher resolution displays by increasing the size of the cluster. Our prototype is now capable of rendering 120 million triangles per second on a 12 mega-pixel display. </p>
